# Plagiarism-Detector

In this project, a simple question and answer system was created. Implemented a program that displays the answer to any question about the given text. You have been given a long text and a list of questions as input to your program. 
A long text and a list of questions were given as input to the program. For each question, an answer is found in the text and printed on the screen. Most of the questions will have one word answers. All questions asked will have an answer in the text, so it is impossible for a question to output "No answer". The answer to a question will not cover more than one sentence, all answers will be in a single sentence in the text.

- **Algorithm/Data Structure**

We used in our Project 2-Dimensional Vector and Linear Search.

- **Big-O Complexity**


```
O(n(n²(n) + n² + n(n))) 

O(n³(n) + n² + n²)

O(n^4 + n² + n²) 

O(n^4) Worst-Case for all Char.
```
